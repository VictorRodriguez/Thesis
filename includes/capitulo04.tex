\section{Budget}
\noindent

Facts about the budget:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All the SW used for development is Open Source
    \item All HW used to make the tests (Atom boards as well as the power
    analyzer) are provided by Intel Tecnologias de Mexico
    \item All HW used in CINVESTAV experiments are provided by CINVESTAV
\end{itemize}

Based on this there is no cost on the experiments
