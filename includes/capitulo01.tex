This work presents a detailed study of how a network of embedded systems
collaborates among each others to solve parallel problems. At the end a
detailed case of study based on: industrial benchmarks for distributed systems,
power consumption analysis and optimal operating system selection, will provide
the IoT and embedded industry a solid methodology to use their compute power as
much as possible.

\section{Background}
\vspace{30 pt}
\noindent

The evolution of computing technology as made incredible progress in the
roughly 60 years since the first general-purpose electronic computer was
created. Today, less than 300 dollars  will purchase a personal computer that
has more performance, more main memory, and more disk storage than a computer
bought in 1985 for 1 million dollars. \cite{Hennessy}. This advantages has been
possible thanks to the innovations in computer design and software design.


%Computter architecture
Since the commercial use of computers (started in 1951 with the
introduction of UNIVAC \cite{Nur}) the development of the computers has had
multiple changes, not only from the architectural point of view but also from
the application point of view. In \cite{Hennessy} the image \textit"{Figure 1:1
Growth in processor performance since the mid-1980s."} shows the evolution of
the computers in term of performance over the years. 

The first important breakpoint in the history of computers came in the late
1970s, whit the emergence of the microprocessor. Since then there has been an
increase in the number of computer business being based on microprocessors. 

The 1980s saw the rise of the desktop computer based on microprocessors, in the
form of both personal computers and workstations. The 1990s saw the emergence
of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the first successful lap top computing
devices, and the emergence of high performance compute systems for business
purposes (servers). During this years the performance of the microprocessors
increase around 27\% each year.\cite{Hennessy}

However in the beginning of 2000's a dramatic change in the computer
architecture happened. The idea of increasing of computing performance in
processors, based on simply screwing up the clock frequency, could not longer
be hold. Due to the fact that the power density (amount of power per unit
volume) increase with the increase in frequency.

The solution, in order to still meet Moore's law, was the shifting to real
parallelism by doubling the number of processors on one chip die. This was the
birth of the multi-core area. This idea increasing the compute power limiting
the power density at the same time. This new computer architecture break the
paradigm of use low compute power microprocessors for embedded platforms.
Instead of this it was possible to have more compute power with less frequency.
Thanks to this radical change there has been a rapid evolution of the compute
and multimedia capabilities of embedded systems. At the point where have more
computer power in our cellphones than all of NASA back in 1969 \cite{Michio}


%Embedded architecture

But the smart-phones are not the only example of embedded platforms.
According to \cite{Hallinan} \textit{"An embedded system is a special-purpose
system in which the computer is completely encapsulated by the device it
controls"} Unlike a general-purpose computer, such as a personal
computer, an embedded system performs pre-defined tasks, usually with very
specific requirements. Examples of these are:microwaves, washing machines, printers,
and GPS (Global Positioning System) systems. All those electronic
gadgets that started to emerge 15 years ago \cite{Nur}.

The variety of the embedded applications requires at the widest spread
of processing power and cost. They include 8-bit and 16-bit processors that may
cost few cents, 32-bit microprocessors that execute 100 million instructions
per second and cost less than few dollars, and high-end processors for the
newest video games or network switches that cost at least 100 dollars and can
execute a billion instructions per second.\cite{Hennessy}

%Ubicuos systems
The combination of all these factors (the cost, size, and power density
reduction) in combination with the increase in computing power and connectivity
has caused the computing technology to evolve into ubiquitous computing.
According to Mark \cite{Mark}, ubiquitous computing is \textit{"the method of
enhancing computer use by making many computers available throughout the
physical environment, but making them effectively invisible to the user"}. This
mean that the computing power is available anywhere and at any time

%IoT

According to \cite{Nur}, currently we are moving from ubiquitous computing into
advanced ubiquitous computing. An advanced ubiquitous computing is an extension
of ubiquitous environment that improve connectivity between devices. The major
characteristics of this environment can be listed as follows: large number of
heterogeneous devices, new communication technology  and Internet of Things
(IoT) among others.


One of the most accurate definitions of the IoT is the one given by
\cite{Bahga} where it mentions that \textit{"Internet of Things refers to
physical and virtual objects that have unique identities and are connected to
the internet to facilitate intelligent applications [...] smarter"}. The IoT
enables the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in
everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. As you can see the
differences with traditional embedded systems are the internet connectivity and
less power consumption. IoT systems must always be connected to the internet
which require a lower power consumption.

But the entire picture of an IoT solution is quite bigger. A full solution has 
the following parts (figure~\ref{fig:1.1}).

\begin{itemize} 

\item The Thing (computing devices):  in the Internet of Things, can be a
person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a bio chip transponder,
an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure
is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IPA
address and provided with the ability to transfer data over a network.

\item Network Connection: Network Connections provides connectivity between
your computing devices  and the Internet, a network, or another compute device.

\item Cloud Computing Data centers for storage and Big Data analysis: The data
by itself is not useful to the end user. An alarm or recommendation is all that
the end user will matter. After the data is sent and stored into the Cloud
Computing Data Centers is necessary to run Big Data solutions that present
meaningfull information to the users.

\item Presentation Devices: At the end of the day, what do we do with all that
information we have collected; one obvious thing is to display the information
via a dashboard. Dashboards have to be hosted on some kind of display, we call
that the Presentation Device.  It could be a desktop computer running an
application, a tablet or a smart phone accessing to a web page. It could even
be a purpose-built device like a retail kiosk, intelligent vending machine or a
control panel. The goal is to present the information coming from the big data
analysis.

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Like many booming areas of technology, the IoT revolution is plagued by a lack
of industry standards. As you can imagine there are thousands of computing
devices and sensors from different vendors that appear on the market  every day
, each one with his unique way to send  or store their data in their
centralized cloud computing centers.

Right now exist two main projects that are compiling to establish standards for
the IoT communications: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Open Connectivity Foundation(OCF): The OCF tries to  create a set of open
specifications and protocols to enable devices from a variety of manufactures
to securely and seamlessly interact with one another. Regardless of the
manufacturer, operating system or chipset the devices that adhere to
the OCF specifications should communicate together.\cite{Terry}

\item AllSeen Alliance (AllJoyn before) : is an open source project for the
development of a universal software framework aimed at the interoperability
among heterogeneous devices, dynamic creation of proximal networks and
execution of distributed applications. The framework provides a common
interface towards smart devices \cite{Massimo}
\end{itemize}


Both standards try to solve a simple problem: communications standards among
the industry. This means that all the IoT devices could communicate among each
others despite the vendor. Despite the efforts of both initiatives none of
those are the standard in terms of IoT technology. 

In the meantime the Internet of Things revolution is here whether we like it or
not. We live in houses with computers inside our air conditions, televisions
and cars; many of them connected to the internet, but as we have seen there are
parts that are being missing. Despite the efforts to develop standard network
protocols for IoT systems there is no effort to make the IoT systems analyze
their data among each others instead of send  all the data to Cloud Data
centers to be analyzed. This could be a problem in a short future because as we
and  the solution might not to add another server (specially when you have
space and economic constrains)


\section{Problem Definition}
\noindent

In order to understand the severity of the problem we have to understand the
magnitude of it, we have to understand that the rise of the IoT
is real.  According to a study by the International Data Corporation (IDC)
\cite{IDC}, a market research analysis and advisory firm specialized in
information technology, the estimated number of IoT devices is approaching  200
billion. And the number of sensors that track, monitor, or feed data to those
things is already more than 50 billion, with scientists talking about
trillion-sensor networks within 10 years. Of course, not all of those 200
billion things are actually wired and communicating on the Internet, but some
20 billion are. And, by 2020, this number will grow by 50\% to 30 billion
connected devices.\cite{EMC1}

But the rise of the internet of things means the rise of data. Imagine for a
moment that the 20 billion of devices try to send 1 kilobyte of data to the
centralized servers, this will create so much traffic that might be similar to
a security attack, collapsing the centralized data centers. One could imagine
that this is not a problem, that we might be exaggerating; but as we saw there
are actual problems like the one Virgin Atlantic airline has.

In 2014 the Boeing 787 aircraft ordered by Virgin Atlantic for delivery
dramatically increases the volume of data the airline will need to deal with
(half terabyte in a transatlantic flight). \cite{Finnegan} Because they can't
handle that much terabytes of data everyday coming from various airplanes they
are looking for cloud base solutions inside the airplanes. Now consider that
the space in an airplane is limited and expensive, moreover the electric
energy. A cloud base solution (adding servers inside the airplane) will require
both space and electric energy.



The rise of IoT will lead to an explosion in the volume of data collected,
transmitted and processed.This will require novel and optimized solutions.  How
can we make the IoT networks self sustainable? Make them solve their own
compute problems without the need to send millions of data to the cloud data
centers?. How can we know when is really necessary to send the data to the cloud
data centers because the number of IoT systems is not efficient ( in terms of
energy and performance)? What kind of applications are good candidates for
these kind of solution? All these questions will be addressed in this work. 

\section{Main Objective}
\noindent

The main objective is to find the maximum number of low ultra-low-voltage
microprocessors platforms that provides the maximum level of energy efficiency.

After finding this information for common benchmarks it will be easy for the
industry of IoT systems to determine if their applications can take advantage
of the communication betwen their IoT devices to process their own data instead
of sending the information to data centers.

\section{Hypothesis}
\noindent

We are confident that with the current technology is possible to generate a
distributed system of ultra-low-voltage microprocessors platforms (core
systems of the IoT devices). The part that we are concern is to determine the
breaking point where is better to send the data to the cloud data centers. How
many systems is the maximum that these kind of network could support and still
being a good option in terms of energy efficiency?

In computing, performance per watt is a measure of the energy efficiency of a
particular computer architecture or computer hardware. Literally, it measures
the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every watt of
power consumed.\cite{Burd} 


\begin{equation}
    Energy Efficiency = \dfrac {Performance}{Watts}
\end{equation}

We believe that the energy efficiency in an embedded cluster will have the
behavior of the  figure~\ref{fig:1.2}. In the beginning the increment of the
number of nodes in our network will increment the performance (the top part of
the equation), but at the same time the amount of watts will
increase making the energy efficiency flat at some point (if the lower part of
the equation increases the equation tends to decrease)


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/graph_1.png}
\caption{Hypothesis of energy efficiency behavior in embedded cluster}
\label{fig:1.2}
\end{figure}

After finding these curves for command benchmarks it will be easy for the
industry of IoT systems to determine if their applications can take advantage
of communicate their IoT devices among each others instead of sending the
information to their data centers.


\section{Methodology}
\noindent

Recent researches \cite{Saldana} \cite{Gallego} \cite{McMahon} \cite{Liu} are 
showing an increasing interest in the topic.  All these research as always talk
about the lack of three parts: 

\begin{itemize}
\item A low-voltage microprocessors platform with enough compute power.
\item An operating system for Distributed Systems.
\item A light communication protocol to distribute the workload among the
embedded platforms.
\end{itemize}

The way we are going to address this will be:


\begin{itemize}

\item Choose the right embedded platform: There are dozens of embedded and IoT
platforms, this is why is necessary to make a deep analysis and choose the best
platform that feed our needs. (taking into consideration that sometimes the
systems might have heterogeneous platforms)

\item Choose the right communication and compute protocol: There are different
kinds of distributed compute protocols. Part of this investigation is to detect
the most reliable and suitable for our needs.

\item Choose the right Operating System for the system. Once we have selected
the appropriate embedded platforms, another variable in this investigation is
the number of Operating Systems. Either if it is a micro kernel or a monolithic
kernel architecture there are more than a dozen of solutions to use.

\item Create embedded clusters to measure energy efficiency. Once we have found
the best configuration (Hardware + Operating System + Communication Protocol )
in terms of energy efficiency , we can start to create a cluster of embedded
systems.

\item Release all the improvements and disagreements found Open Source and
public. All the improvements made into any technology (operating systems or
communication protocols) will be published with an open source license.

\item Implement solution on real application ( greenhouse ). In order to test
the hypothesis in a real application we will implement it on a real greenhouse.
Proving that the solution give an embedded system the power of reliability and
availability without the need of external and expensive servers.
\end{itemize}
